# My-TO-DO-LIST
In this project, I leveraged the power of JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation to create an interactive and user-friendly to-do list application. By employing fundamental concepts like document.getElementById(), addEventListener(), e.target, appendChild(), createElement(), parentElement(), remove(), and classList.add(), I was able to build a seamless and efficient experience for users.

Key Features:

✔️ User Interaction: Users can easily add, edit, and remove tasks by simply interacting with the list.

✔️ Dynamic Updates: The list dynamically updates as new tasks are added or removed without requiring page refresh.

✔️ Responsive Design: The application is designed to adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.

Technologies Used:

🔧 HTML: Structuring the foundation of the to-do list.

🎨 CSS: Styling to achieve a modern and visually appealing interface.

💻 JavaScript: Implementing the dynamic functionality and interactivity using DOM manipulation.


I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project as it allowed me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling. Moreover, the experience of building a practical application from scratch has honed my problem-solving and coding skills.
